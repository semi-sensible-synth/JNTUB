# Front panels

There are several options for JNTUB front panels here:

- `gerber/panels` are specific designs with labels for a particular firmware (LFO, ENV etc)
- `gerber/generic_sharpie` is a design with blank silkscreen regions intended to be labeled with a "Sharpie" style marker (this can be erased by cleaning with alcohol). This panel can be also be flipped to use generic silkscreened labels on the other side (eg PARAM1 etc). These panels are useful if you don't want to commit to a particular firmware. Also good for prototyping.
- `stl` contains a 3D printable design, with OpenSCAD code. The result is usable, but not typically not very aesthetically pleasing or durable.
